# CNNs glossary #3

<div markdown="1" style="font-size:2vw">

- CNNs are trained in two phases:
	- in the forward pass, features are extracted from the input image and the output of the network is compared to the ground truth through a loss function
	- in the backward pass, neurons' parameters (weights and biases) are adjusted through [backpropagation (1989)](https://www.nature.com/articles/323533a0){: .pleaseletmeclickonthislink5px} and gradient descent

- Before ResNets, the vanishing gradient problem made deep CNNs difficult to train, because the so called "loss landscape" was too noisy for gradient descent to make progress
