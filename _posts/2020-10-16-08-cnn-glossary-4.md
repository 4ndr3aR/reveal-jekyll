# CNNs glossary #4

<div markdown="1" style="font-size:2vw">


- At a higher level of abstraction, a CNN model is trained starting from:
	- the network architecture (ResNet-34, ResNet-50, EfficientNet-B4, etc.)
	- the dataset (typically composed of training/validation/test set) and a set of data augmentation transformations
	- the loss function (crossentropy loss, MSE, MAE, etc.)
	- the choice of hyperparameters (batch size, learning rate, number of training epochs, etc.)
