##### **problem outline**

<div markdown="1" style="font-size:2vw">

- At present, a problem of great collective interest
	- for ordinary citizens and car owners
	- for municipalities
	- it also fits into the broader context of autonomous driving research
- CNR-IMATI carries out this research as part of a project funded by MISE
	- project name: <span style="color:#e8103f"><b>5G Genova</b></span>
	- 6 partners: CNR, Vodafone, AMT, Municipality of Genova, Leonardo S.p.a., START 4.0
	- start date: Oct '20
	- 1st year is over, still 1 year to go
	- in a nutshell, the goal of our scenario is the detection of potholes and cracks on the road surface by installing low-cost cameras on an AMT bus equipped with a new Leonardo 5G unit
	- the 5G link and computational capacity for Deep Learning models are provided by Vodafone
