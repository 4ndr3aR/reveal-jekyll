# 3D Dynamic Hand Gestures Recognition
##### **training the network and results**

<div markdown="1" style="font-size:2vw">

- The network has been trained in Python using Jupyter Notebook and the Fast.ai v1 library
	- a little bit more high level than Pytorch
	- great community that keeps it up to date with literature
- ResNet-50 pretrained on ImageNet and on [our other 2k image hand gestures dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01450){: .pleaseletmeclickonthislink}
	- [Progressive resizing technique](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/740548v3.full){: .pleaseletmeclickonthislink5px} (192x108, 384x216, 576x324 and 960x540)
	- Standard augmentation (rotate, crop+pad, flip, warp, zoom, brightness, contrast)
	- Fit one cycle policy for training [(i.e. cyclical learning rate)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.01186.pdf){: .pleaseletmeclickonthislink5px}
