# Future research directions #1

<div markdown="1" style="font-size:2vw">

- What's the weak point of our current approach?
	- There is no way to determine when a gesture starts or ends (it's just a "single image" classifier)
	- Once again, the developer has the burden of deciding when one gesture ends and another begins, when two predictions are part of the same gesture, etc.
- How do we do it?
	- One prediction every second (avg. duration of the gestures)
	- Thresholds
