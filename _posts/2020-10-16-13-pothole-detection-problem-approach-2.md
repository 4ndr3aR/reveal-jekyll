# The pothole detection problem
##### **our approach to automate the collection of masks for training**

- What is a RGB-D camera?
	- also called stereo camera (or simply depth cam), it's made by two monochrome eyes (plus the RGB one)
	- disparity is computed comparing the output of the left eye with that of the right eye
	- capable of extracting depth information as well as the normal RGB stream ([video](http://deeplearning.ge.imati.cnr.it/genova-5G/video/crocetta-field-tests/wls-2021-06-08-17-44-28-libx265-short-fixed.html){: .pleaseletmeclickonthislink8px})
- Ok for the theory, but what about "the quantity"?
	- solution: install the depth cam on "some vehicle"
