# Lessons learned #1

<div markdown="1" style="font-size:2vw">

- Trained on SHREC 2020 + SHREC 2021 contest dataset
	- 468 + 542 = 1010 training sequences
	- 18 classes + the _nongesture_ class
	- This time not just single images, but entire sequences
	- Sequences with old+new data augmentations
		- partial sequences + noise
		- 3D hand rotations along horizontal and vertical plane
	- A total of 72720 WebP image sequences generated (47 Gb)
	
- "_World class_" training results
	- 96.2% accuracy on the validation set
