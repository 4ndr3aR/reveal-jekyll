# Lessons learned #2

<div markdown="1" style="font-size:2vw">

- What about test time accuracy for the contest?
	- close to 50% accuracy
	- as the old non fine-tuned method
	
- Reason number 1: sequences too short
	- 10 frames = too little context
	- we chose spatial resolution over the temporal one
- Other reasons
	- lack of time (just 1 month for the whole contest)
	- the whole architecture wasn't quite ready
	- Fast.ai v2 type dispatch is a little nightmare
